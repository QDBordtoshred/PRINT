Simultaneously, a nested table is declared to store numeric values, offering flexibility in handling numerical data. Additionally, an associative array is declared with an index of PLS_INTEGER, providing a dynamic structure to hold VARCHAR2 values based on the specified index. These declarations showcase the versatility of collections in SQL, allowing for efficient management of various data types."
